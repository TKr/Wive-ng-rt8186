		The ESSID bug
		-------------

	The latest Linux kernels have a bug in the handling of the
ESSID. The Linux kernel maintainers seems reluctant to fix this bug.

Symptoms :
--------
	1) There is a trailing '\x00' in the ESSID.
	2) If a ESSID with 32 character is set, it can not be read again.
                http://madwifi.org/ticket/930

Resolution :
----------
	The patch provided in the Wireless Tools package should fix
this problem. This patch remove a backward compatibility hack, and it
is safe as it simplify the code.
	The patch need to be applied to the kernel, the kernel
recompiled and reinstalled.
	If you have kernel 2.6.19 to 2.6.21 :
		use iw261_restore_full_essid.diff
	If you have kernel 2.6.22 or later :
		use iw261_restore_full_essid.diff
	I won't give detailed instructions because only people
confortable with kernel rebuild should attempt this.

Workaround :
----------
	Using Wireless Tools 29 will hide the trailing '\x00'
character (first symptom). There is no workaround for the second
symptom.


	Good luck...

	Jean
