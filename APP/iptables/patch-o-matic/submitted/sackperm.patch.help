Attached patch fixes a bug in the SACKPERM delete function of netfilter.

The previous code replaced SACKPERM with 00 (== end of options) instead of
01 (== NOOP).

Yes, as discussed on netdev, the right thing is to make netfilter deal with
SACK correctly.  But until the code for this is in place and tested, we still
need to delete the SACKPERM option... and we should do it correctly.
