skb->pkt_type packet match support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_PKTTYPE
  This patch allows you to match packet in accrodance
  to its "class", eg. BROADCAST, MULTICAST, ...
  
  Typical usage:
  iptables -A INPUT -m pkttype --pkt-type broadcast -j LOG
  
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
