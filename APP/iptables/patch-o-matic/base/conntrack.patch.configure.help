CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE
conntrack match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_CONNTRACK
  This is a general conntrack match module, a superset of the state match.

  It allows matching on additional conntrack information, which is
  useful in complex configurations, such as NAT gateways with multiple
  internet links or tunnels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
