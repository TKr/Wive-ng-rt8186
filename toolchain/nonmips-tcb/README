nonmips-tcb - a GNU toolchain builder for patent-free MIPS clones

1. Introduction

This is a set of scripts allowing easy compilation of GNU cross-compiler 
toolchains for MIPS clone CPUs that don't support the patented MIPS 
instruction subset (such as Realtek's RTL8181 SoC).
The scripts are a variation of Erik Andersen's toolchain builder from 
uClibc.org, with a few changes in kernel headers and gcc patches.

For more information about open-source support for patent-free MIPS
clones, see the project's website at http://nonmips.sourceforge.net

2. Quick start instructions

- Edit the top-level Makefile, change the CROSSTOOLS_HOMEDIR variable 
if not happy with the default.
- If building for other CPU than RTL8181, edit the uClibc.config 
file in the ./sources directory to match your architecture specifics. 
This step is *not* necessary when building for RTL8181.
- Type "make" and wait for the process to complete. The scripts will 
download all necessary sources from the Internet (~40 MiB), build the 
toolchain and install it in the specified directory. It may take quite 
a lot of time to complete the entire process, so be patient. 
- Set your PATH to include $CROSSTOOLS_HOMEDIR/mips-patfree-uclibc/bin 
(/opt/cross/mips-patfree-uclibc/bin in the default case).
- Go compile something. :)

3. More information

The enabling bit of the patent-free port is the gcc-patfree patch. 
This "unofficial" patch disables the generation of patented MIPS 
instructions, by falling back to less optimal code generation strategies 
that don't use these instructions.
A copy of the gcc-patfree patch for gcc-3.3.3 is included in the current 
distribution, as "gcc-uclibc-3.3-300-patfree.patch" (to comply with the 
uClibc patch naming convention).

Other modifications from Erik's original toolchain builder include:
- a set of kernel headers from the RTL8181 Linux project (a patent-free 
MIPS kernel), possibly modified from the original kernel.org version.
- better control of installation target directory through the use of a 
new Makefile variable (CROSSTOOLS_HOMEDIR).
- a modified uClibc.config file, tailored for the specifics of the 
RTL8181 project (MIPS1, Big-endian, MMU).
- the file that you're reading now.

4. What exactly are the files being downloaded?

- GCC sources from gcc.gnu.org
- BINUTILS from ftp.kernel.org
- CCACHE from ccache.samba.org
- Patched Linux kernel headers from the RTL8181 project (rtl8181.sf.net)
- UCLIBC from www.uClibc.org

See the corresponding .mk files in ./make for details. All files are 
downloaded to ./sources/dl.
